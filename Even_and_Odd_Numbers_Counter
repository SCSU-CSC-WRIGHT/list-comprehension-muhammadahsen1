# Step 1: Ask the user for a list of integers
numbers = input("Enter integers separated by spaces: ").split()
numbers = [int(num) for num in numbers]  # Convert strings to integers

# Step 2: Initialize counters for even and odd numbers
even_count = 0
odd_count = 0

# Step 3: Use a loop to count even and odd numbers
for num in numbers:
    if num % 2 == 0:  # Check if the number is even
        even_count += 1
    else:  # If not even, it's odd
        odd_count += 1

# Step 4: Print the counts
print(f"Count of even numbers: {even_count}")
print(f"Count of odd numbers: {odd_count}")
